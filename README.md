### Hi there 👋

I started working in software when I was 16 years old, an age in which you don't suppose to work since it's also illegal but I found my way to join a local publicity studio from a member of a friend's family, at the same time I was studying in high school. I created their website and then started designing their client's corporate websites, of course the clients never knew the person behind was me with 16 years old. It was funny and productive since I could focus on doing things without having to interact with clients since at that time I didn't even knew how to do it. On those days I learnt Front-end, Back-end and the basics of server configurations since I got to do everything, also the UI design.

I’m now a Software designer mostly focused on Front-end technologies like Angular and Svelte, Back-end with Node, Python and MySql. Currently working at _Perficient_ and a few personal projects. Before that I worked for _Envada_ and _Globant_. 10+ years of experience in software development. 

Some tech information about me:

### I'm writing short articles about (Coming soon):

- Open source technologies.
- Auto-pilot.
- [Less people](posts/less-people.md)
- Create your environment.
- Privacy.
- Less social media.
- [User interfaces](posts/user-interfaces.md)

Since you have spent some time reading this, I want to give you some tips you might like:

- [Brave](https://brave.com/): A secure and private browser.
- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/): If you don't want to be tracked by Mi---soft and all their telemetry layer and if you respect your own privacy you can use VSCodium which is the project in which VSCode is based on and is open source & free.
- [VIM](https://www.vim.org/): You can use VIM as well as code editor or at least as the default terminal text editor.
- [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/): Bring some great features to your terminal. Then you can check [ohmyz](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki): If you really use your terminal, multiplex it using Tmux.
