### Hi there 👋

I'm a software developer mostly focused on Front-end technologies like Angular and Vue, also some stuff in the BE with Node and Python. I'm currently working for _Overactive_ and in some personal projects. Before that I worked for _Envada_ and _Globant_. I have 10+ years of experience in software development. 

Some information about me:

### Things I feel are right (I'll be writting short articles about them soon):

- Open source technologies.
- Auto-pilot.
- Less virtual meetings (Think about it, more than half the ones you're having aren't probably needed). 
- [Less people](posts/less-people.md)
- Create your environment.
- Privacy.
- Less social media.
- [User interfaces](posts/user-interfaces.md)

Since you have took some time to read this, I want to give you some tips you might like:

- [Brave](https://brave.com/): A secure and private browser.
- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/): If you don't want to be tracked by Mi---soft and all their telemetry layer and if you respect your own privacy you can use VSCodium which is the project in which VSCode is based on and is open source & free.
- [VIM](https://www.vim.org/): You can use VIM as well as code edditor or at least as the default terminal text edditor.
- [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/): Bring some great features to your terminal. Then you can check [ohmyz](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki): If you really use your terminal, multiplex it using Tmux.
