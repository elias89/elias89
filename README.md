### Hi there 👋

I’m a Software designer mostly focused on Front-end technologies like Angular and Svelte, Back-end with Node, Python and MySql. Currently working at _Overactive_ and a few personal projects. Before that I worked for _Envada_ and _Globant_. 10+ years of experience in software development.

### I'm writting short articles about (Comming soon):

- Open source technologies.
- Auto-pilot.
- [Less people](posts/less-people.md)
- Create your environment.
- Privacy.
- Less social media.
- User interfaces.
- Be technologically organic.

Since you have spent some time reading this, I want to give you some tips you might like:

- [Brave](https://brave.com/): A secure and private browser.
- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/): If you don't want to be tracked by Mi---soft and all their telemetry layer and if you respect your own privacy you can use VSCodium which is the project in which VSCode is based on and is open source & free.
- [VIM](https://www.vim.org/): You can use VIM as well as code edditor or at least as the default terminal text edditor.
- [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/): Bring some great features to your terminal. Then you can check [ohmyz](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki): If you really use your terminal, multiplex it using Tmux.
