# LESS PEOPLE
Always less is more, even when talking about people.

Don't get me wrong, I love people but when it comes to a software project (and I'm sure in other areas as well) not always having more people will produce more results. Always choose quality over quantity and if you don't find the right people to do something keep looking, or probably change the way you interview.

It's very commmon to see people interviewing with the same list of questions for all candidates. We're all different so having a set of predefined questions will always lead you to lack of accuracy results. Explore the person asking non technical questions at the beggining, create the circunstances for they to talk about what motivates them and introduce little technical questions on the flow. Make them feel happy and comfortable so they'll respond with what they really know, pressing someone with difficult questions making they feel nervous it's just stupid they'll not answer properly and you wont get the right results you're looking for. Put yourself in a situation making feel them you're same as them, not any higher so that creates the circunstances to see who they really are.

Put people to work on what they really enjoy so they'll naturally be focused and produce much more better results. The key for a product to succeed is the people feeling motivated. You can have a great idea but if no one feels atracted to what they're doing you'll never make your idea really happen. A single feature in a product can lead it to the sucess and that kind of features are born from the inside mind of someone feeling motivated. That motivation produces people to work hard, to work more and that feature could be born out of regular working ours. No one will continue thinking and working out of regular ours if they're not motivated. Don't press people to make them work more, that produces nothing but stress. Create the circnstances to make them feel angaged and they'll naturally work more. Not just in front of the computer, they'll wake up thinking on the product they're building.

Having the right people is not easy, is not fast but when you get them, they'll stay with you, they will be really profitable so always choose just the right ones for what they have to do and leave them create, hear them, show to them you're interested on their ideas and make great employees ideas happen, that is priceless.

I've been involved in projects with 10 people in which just 3 of them do more than the seven remaining ones. It's 
very common to hear managers or c-level people stick to the fact that they always need more resources and the reason is they're hiring the wrong ones, they're in an ilusional rush to hire which is not always right. When you hire someone that person needs an on-boarding, needs deep code reviews, needs atention, needs time so make sure you're investing it in the right people, otherwise it will always be expensive. Juniors with the wrong motivation are usually more expensive. Time is never recovered, money does, have that in mind.
